# APGCE Geohack 2024

On Nov 16 - 18 2024, 10 teams of five gathered at Common Ground Bukit Bintang, Kuala Lumpur to hack together geo-data science solutions in the span of 48 hours. This year, participants are given a real dataset of seismic images from an undisclosed field, and are asked to perform fault segmentation or horizon picking from these images using computer vision methods.

Following is a compilation of the hard work done by all teams in this hackathon! (Compilation in progress)
